# **App Name**: WebRay

## Core Features:

- Map Display: Display a 2D map representation of the environment. This will provide a top-down view to help the user understand the layout.
- Raycasting Engine: Implement a raycasting engine to render a pseudo-3D environment based on the map data. The engine should handle ray collision detection with walls.
- First-Person Perspective: Simulate a first-person perspective by rendering the environment as seen from a specific camera position and orientation.
- Movement Controls: Implement keyboard controls to allow the user to move forward, backward, turn left, and turn right within the simulated environment.
- Texturing: Apply textures to the walls and floors to enhance the visual realism of the rendered environment.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark Blue (#293462) for the immersive, tech-driven feel of exploring virtual spaces.
- Background color: Very dark desaturated blue (#1E2640) to provide a deep and immersive background.
- Accent color: Yellow (#FFF1C1) to highlight interactive elements and navigation prompts within the interface.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for both headlines and body text. Clean, modern, and readable to maintain the player's focus.
- Use simple, geometric icons for any UI elements such as settings or help. Ensure they are intuitive and complement the retro aesthetic.
- Maintain a minimalist layout with the 3D view taking up the majority of the screen. Overlay a small map in the corner if necessary, but avoid clutter.
- Subtle transitions when the player moves or turns to enhance the sensation of moving in the environment.
